## About The Project

This branch is entitled to showcase how you can get started integrating/using [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) which makes use of the [Gnosis Safe SDK](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-core-sdk) to create and interact with the safe to execute multi-sig transactions.


## Getting Started


### Installation

Let's start our environment for tinkering and exploring how NFT auction would work.

1. Clone the repo first
```sh
git clone -b gnosis-starter-kit https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git gnosis
cd gnosis
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Start your React frontend and make sure you are connect your rinkeby wallet
```bash
yarn start
```

## Deployment

This branch has no dependency on any smart contract the safe deployment is taken care by the SDK so in order to deploy un-comment the code [here](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/blob/gnosis-starter-kit/packages/react-app/src/views/GnosisStarterView.jsx#L35-L39) and make sure you set the thresold and owner params on line 38 and make sure you update the safe address [here](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/blob/gnosis-starter-kit/packages/react-app/src/views/GnosisStarterView.jsx#L29) after deployment

### Note

- The Branch currently is tested on the Rinkeby network so make sure to connect your rinkeby wallet

- Make sure after deployment you fund your safe with eth.
